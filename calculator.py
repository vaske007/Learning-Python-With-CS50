# 'int', which is short for integers, is a number all the way toward negative infinity, and all the way toward positive infinity. But there is no decimal point in an integer.
# Python, just like in math, looks at the innermost parentheses first, and when it gets its answer, it continues to the next parentheses...

x = int(input("What's x? ")) # Input function gets called first and then the result of that becomes the inputto the int function
y = int(input("What's y? ")) # Input function gets called first and then the result of that becomes the inputto the int function

print(x + y)
