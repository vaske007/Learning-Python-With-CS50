Conditional or conditional statements, are the ability to ask questions and answer thoose questions, in order to decide which line of code you want to run.
The if statement asks a queastion, and if it is true, it does what it's told.
The statement elif, stands for else if, in English, which allows us to ask a question that takes into account whether or not a previous answer a true or false answer.
The else statement does the same thing as the elif statement, if the code before it is false it runs, just without asking a quesiton which is why it is always where the last elif would have been. The fact that it doesn't ask a question means that it also runs faster.
The or statement returns the value if either or both operands are true.
